3D Design of a 6-motor robotic leg using Shaper 3D

## Introduction

This project focuses on the 3D design of an advanced robotic leg powered by 6 individual motors. 
By leveraging the capabilities of Shaper 3D CAD software, we aim to create a leg with enhanced flexibility and degrees of freedom for improved mobility on unstructured terrain.

## The application used

I used the 3d sheper app

## The problems I had at the beginning
Difficulty drawing with high accuracy to master the desired shape

And also the consistency of the entrances with the shape of the legs.

And also the application of servo entrance measurements

 ## First, the base or legs

 ## here I designed a place for the servo according to its existing measurements
